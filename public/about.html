<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Camila Perez Romero. I am a 21 year-old university student at Universidad de las Americas Puebla.
  I was born on May 21st of 2002 in Mexico city.   </p>

<p>My parents and I moved to Puebla when I was 3 years old and we lived there until I was 15. 
  At that age my dad started working abroad and I was sent to boarding school so I wouldn't have move around so much with the rest
  of my family. I made lots of friends in boarding school but missed my parents from time to time. However, I learned alot about living alone
  and adapting to a new culture. After graduting from High School I came back to Puebla and started university. </p>

<p>On my freetime I like reading, baking and watching movies. My favorite movies are often animated or romantic comedies. Once I gradute collage I would like to adopt a dog and live on my own. </p>
